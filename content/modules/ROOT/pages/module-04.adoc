Letâ€™s run a stress test on `+rhel2+` and `+rhel3+`

Click on the `+rhel2+` terminal tab.

.rhel2

Paste the following command.

[source,bash]
----
stress --cpu 16 --io 3 --vm 5 --vm-bytes 128M --timeout 60s

`+stress+` is a utility for generating artificial loads on cpu, memory,
and disk. You can play around with the `+--cpu+`, `+--io+`, and `+--vm+`
flags to generate different loads. `+--timeout+` specifies the duration
of the test.

Click on `+rhel3+` terminal tab and paste the same or similar `+stress+`
command as above to generate an artificial load.

When these `+stress+` tests are complete, go back to the Grafana
dashboard and view the performance metrics of the `+rhel2+` and
`+rhel3+` hosts. The dashboards might take a minute or two to update.

You can also experiment with the dash board scales and intervals.
